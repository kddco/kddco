### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Hello i am KDDC
I am a boring guy who thinks about bypassing EDR all day long. I enjoy exploring new knowledge in cybersecurity, with a particular interest in blue defense and server deployment research. What I love even more is sharing my learning experiences and knowledge on Hackmd or GitHub, where I often showcase my own homemade tools.
